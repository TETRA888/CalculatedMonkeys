# This is a simple script that randomly assigns colors to the faces of "Suzzane" the monkey from Blender, adds a VR headset and also arranges the generated monkeys in a circular array!
## The way it works is quite simple, here are the steps:
### 1. We initially, generate the monkey mesh using primitive Blender-Python operations
### 2. Next, we select the individual monkeyh mesh and iterate through the faces using a library called BMesh, this essentially provides easier mesh handling
### 3. We then randomly assign the color to that face and thats it!

## Now as for the VR headset, well...
### 1. The same primitive mesh generation principles are used to create an overall mesh that looks like a VR headset
### 2. I created the VR headset manually and then automated it via the Blender-Python scripting. I found this process a lot more efficient when it comes to automating mesh generation.

## To position the monkeys, its pretty simple highschool math
### 1. you calculate the x and y coordinates using sines and cosines

### 2. Additionally, you can tweak a few parameters such as the radius and the number of steps or "jumps" on the unit circle
### 3. to calculate these steps its pretty simple you just use the formula: angle_increment = ùúè/steps which essentially just means you divide a 360 degree circle into n steps 
### and increment the angle based on the angle_increment
### 4. For example: you have a circle that is 2*œÄ === ùúè === 360 degrees, you then want to divide that 360 circle into steps. So lets say we went 6 monkeys, you would divide 360/6 which equals 60 for the angle_increment
###    So our angles would be: 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360.
### 5. Finally, once the x and y coordinates are calculated, you simple position the monkey in that position.

## However, you also need to make sure that the monkey faces away from the center otherwise your generated mesh would just look like this:

### 1. To correct for this, I found that you can assign the Z-axis rotation of the monkey mesh to the (current angle + œÄ/2), after doing so you get this:
