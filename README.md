# This is a simple script that randomly assigns colors to the faces of Suzzane the monkey from Blender
## The way it works is quite simple, here are the steps:
### 1. We initially, generate the monkey mesh using primitive Blender-Python operations
### 2. Next, we select the individual mesh and iterate through the faces using a library called BMesh, this essentially provides easier mesh handling
### 3. We then randomly assign the color to that face and thats it!

## Now as for the VR headset, well...
### 1. The same primitive mesh generation principles are used to create an overall mesh that looks like a VR headset

## To position the monkeys, its pretty simple highschool math
### 1. you calculate the x and y coordinates using sines and cosines

### 2. Additionally, you can tweak a few parameters such as the radius and the number of steps or "jumps" on the unit circle
### 3. to calculate these steps its pretty simple you just use the formula: angle_increment = ùúè/steps which essentially just means you divide a 360 degree circle into n steps 
and increment the angle based on the angle_increment.
